### Analysis and Interactive Visualisations on Global Temperature Change

Roughly 1 degree Celcius increase in global average surface temperature that has occured since the pre-industrial era(1850-1900) that might seem small however its impact is devastating. In this project, I analysed and visualized the temperature change from pre-industrial era to 2021, as well as the damage caused by global warming on icebergs in Antartica, Tibetian Plateau and Grand Plateau Glacier with Ipython.

### Statistical Analysis and Interactive Visualisations on Renewable Energy Production in California

Renewable energy production in California has tripled since 2010, the main contributor of this growth is the solar energy production. In this project, I demostrated the daily and yearly seasonality effect on renewable energy production by performing imputation of missing values, statistical and time series analysis on energy data as well as interactive time series visualisations.

### Markov Chain Simulation to Predict Weather for Solar Energy Production

Solar panels need sunlight to produce electricity, when it is cloudy, it produces less electricity or none. This variability makes maintaining a stable and reliable green energy production more complex. In this project, I created a  Markov chain stochastic model to predict the weather conditions for solar energy production.

### Sales Predictions with Linear Regression Model

Accurate sales forecasting can help businesses anticipate future demand, identify potential problems such as stock out, or opportunities (sell more!) and adjust their strategies accordingly. In this project, I applied statistical analysis on variables that impact sales as well as historical sales figures themselves, such as correlation between variables by handling multicolinearity. And finally, predicted future sales and evaluated the prediction model.

### Ads Click Prediction with Logistic Regression Model

It is crucial to understand your customers' profile and target the right customer segment for advertisements. Advertisements that have the most elevated to be clicked are chosen using supervised machine learning calculation. In this project, I completed Exploratory Data Analysis on customer data and performed feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning algorithm. I was able to predict if a customer will click the ads with 0.9 F score.

### A/B Testing on How Communication Style Impact People to Take Climate Action 

It is not what you but how you say it! Is it actually true? In this project, i analyzed if optimistic speech about climate change is more effective than pessimistic approach to make people take climate action by cleaning and tranforming data with feature engineering for machine learning algorithm. Unfortunately, according to bayesian hypothesis testing, there is no statistical difference between optimistic and pessimistic approach to make people take climate action.
